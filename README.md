********Understanding Multiple Linear Regression: A Comprehensive Guide
In the world of data science and statistics, modeling complex relationships between variables is crucial for making informed decisions. 
One powerful tool in this toolkit is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).
This technique allows us to understand and predict the behavior of a dependent variable based on several independent variables. 
In this blog post, we'll explore what Multiple Linear Regression is, how to implement it using Python, 
its mathematical background, and real-world applications.

********What is Multiple Linear Regression?***
Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. Unlike simple linear regression, which involves a single predictor, MLR can handle multiple predictors to provide a more nuanced understanding of how different factors influence the outcome.

In mathematical terms, the MLR model can be represented as:

ùëå = Œ≤ +  Œ≤1X1 + Œ≤2X2 + .......... + Œ≤nXn + œµ
where , 
Y is independent , X1 , X2, X3 are dependent 
B0 is y-intercept
œµ = error ( Differnece between observed and Predicted values )

************Mathematical Background************
The goal of MLR is to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared errors 
between the observed values and the predicted values. This process is known as "least squares estimation."
